# In-Game-Player-Analysis

## Introduction

This repository contains a code written for the examination of player behavior within the game environment. 

## Aim

Through exploration, the idea was to enhance understanding of how player engagement and monetization efforts intersect within the game ecosystem. 

The primary objective was to investigate the effect of special ads designed to monetize users who typically do not engage with video ads in regular placements and are not in-game payers.

## Data

Data encompasses various fields of in-game engagement, player history, and relevant variables, serving as the starting point for analysis. 

## Analysis

The data was processed with dask, numpy and pandas, while Plotly was used for visualizations.
